UserProductApp is a simple, yet robust app. The user registration process is straightforward, with a dedicated POST endpoint specified in the Swagger API. The request body requires essential parameters such as email, password, first name, and last name. To ensure data integrity, backend validation mechanisms are in place to verify compliance with predefined criteria, including valid email formats and robust passwords. Upon successful registration, users receive a confirmation email, and their details are securely stored in the database.The login process is equally efficient, with a POST endpoint designated for user authentication. Upon validation, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and returned in the response, enabling secure access to subsequent API requests. This token must be included in the Authorization header for authenticated requests.The application's core functionality revolves around product management, offering a range of CRUD operations. These endpoints enable users to effortlessly manage products, with pagination and filter support ensuring a seamless experience.
